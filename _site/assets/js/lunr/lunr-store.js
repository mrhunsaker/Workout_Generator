    "title": "About",
    "excerpt":"About Me   I earned a Ph.D. in neuroscience (behavioral neuroscience focus) from UC Davis in 2012, followed by postdoctoral work in primate neural development at the MIND Institute. During this time, I developed research methods to evaluate developmental disorders and gained experience working with children and adults across a wide range of diagnoses—from autism and cerebral palsy to genetic conditions like fragile X syndrome and Williams syndrome.   I have experience working directly with children and adults across a wide range of diagnoses: autism, cerebral palsy, fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, ADHD, Tourette’s syndrome, and many others. This diversity of experience has taught me how individual each student’s needs are.   In 2014, I made a deliberate shift. Rather than pursue a traditional academic career, I wanted to apply my scientific training directly in classrooms. I became a special education teacher focused on understanding how each student’s disability uniquely shapes their learning needs and on developing teaching approaches that help them access their potential.   In 2019, I earned a Master’s degree in Special Education with a credential to teach blind and visually impaired students. I’ve since specialized in working with students who are visually impaired and have additional disabilities, grounding all my work in both neuroscience and practical classroom experience.   Through my years of teaching, I’ve noticed a persistent gap: accessible educational resources that are both practical and affordable are hard to find. This gap inspired TVI Resources—a collection of free, openly licensed materials designed to meet the real needs of educators working with visually impaired students.   About This Site   TVI Resources is a curated collection of free, open-source materials designed specifically for teachers of students with visual impairments. Rather than a research database or a product catalog, it’s a living library of classroom-tested tools: ready-made templates, 3D models you can print locally, small scripts and utilities, and detailed instructions for adapting materials to your needs.   This site exists because teachers deserve better options. Many teachers working with students who are blind or visually impaired face a common problem: accessible classroom materials are expensive, difficult to customize, and often designed without real classroom feedback. TVI Resources flips that script by publishing source files, build notes, and the actual processes used to create these materials—so you can adapt, reproduce, and improve them for your specific students and context.   How to Use This Site   Finding what you need: Browse by category or use the search bar to find resources for specific topics. Each resource page includes:      A clear description of what it is and what it does   Step-by-step instructions for use or creation   Source files (where applicable) so you can modify and adapt   Notes on materials, costs, and accessibility features   Feedback from other teachers who’ve used it   Modifying for your classroom: Most resources are published with editable source files (SVG, STL, Python, shell script, etc.). You’re encouraged to change fonts, scale, labels, spacing, or instructions to match your curriculum and students’ needs. No permission required—just keep the license notice if you redistribute.   Getting the most from scripts and utilities: The command-line tools and small applications here are designed to run with minimal setup on Windows, macOS, or Linux systems. Each includes usage notes and examples. If you’re not comfortable with the command line, the instructions walk you through it step-by-step.   Philosophy: Open, Transparent, Iterative   TVI Resources is built on four core principles:   1. Transparency Over Authority   Each resource includes not just a finished product, but the process used to create it: the file formats, the decisions made, the trade-offs considered. This transparency serves two purposes. First, it lets you judge whether the approach fits your classroom and students—you can see why something was designed a certain way, not just that it was. Second, it invites scrutiny and improvement. When someone finds a better way to do something, they can share it, and the resource evolves. Just as importantly, if a resource has limitations or doesn’t work well in certain contexts, that information is openly available rather than hidden behind polished marketing.   I created these resources based on my experience and the feedback I’ve received, but I am keenly aware of the limits of my perspective. I cannot possibly anticipate every classroom context, student need, or niche application these materials might encounter. I welcome—and genuinely want—your feedback on what isn’t working, what’s missing, or how a resource falls short for your specific situation. This includes edge cases I didn’t foresee, unusual student needs, specialized curriculum applications, or contexts very different from what I had in mind when I created something. Please don’t hesitate to reach out and tell me where these resources come up short. Your honesty helps me improve them for everyone.   2. Adaptation Over One-Size-Fits-All   Accessibility is not universal—it’s deeply contextual. A tactile diagram that works perfectly for one student might not work for another. A font size or braille spacing that suits one curriculum might not fit another. By publishing source files and build processes, these resources support the core idea that teachers (and families, and local makerspaces) are the experts in what their students need. The goal is not to dictate solutions but to provide starting points that educators can confidently modify.   What this also means is that I recognize the resources here are built from my perspective and experiences. You may encounter situations, student profiles, accessibility needs, or specialized applications that my initial designs didn’t account for. That’s not a flaw in the approach—it’s exactly why the source files and processes are available. But it also means I’d genuinely appreciate hearing about those gaps. If you find yourself thinking, “This would work great if…” or “This doesn’t address…”, please let me know. Those insights help me understand where the resources are falling short and where improvements or new variations might be most helpful.   3. Sustainability Through Community   Centralized, commercial products eventually become outdated, discontinued, or financially unaffordable. Open, community-maintained resources can evolve indefinitely. When teachers share feedback, report bugs, or post better versions of a resource, the whole collection improves. This distributed model also means no single person or organization has to shoulder the burden of maintaining everything—it grows and improves through shared effort.   I’m committed to this iterative improvement, but I can’t do it alone—and I wouldn’t want to. My understanding of what works in classrooms is shaped by the teachers I’ve worked with directly, which represents only a small slice of how these resources might be used. Teachers working with different student populations, in different curricula, in different countries, or with specialized accessibility needs may discover aspects of these resources that need rethinking. I want to hear about those discoveries. Whether it’s a comment on a resource page, an email noting what didn’t work, or a bug report about something that breaks in unexpected ways, your feedback is how this collection grows beyond my individual limitations and serves the broader community of educators.   4. Cost as a Measure of Access   Free materials with publicly available source files represent a commitment to equity. When resources are openly licensed and can be created locally—through printing, 3D fabrication, or scripting—they remove financial barriers that often exclude students and teachers with limited budgets. Cost isn’t the only measure of access, but it’s a crucial one.   How This Differs From Other Resources   Many accessibility sites focus on teaching about accessible design or publishing research. TVI Resources is different: it publishes ready-to-use materials. You can download an SVG, modify it in 10 minutes, and have tactile diagrams printing by afternoon. You can run a Python script and generate 50 large-print worksheets from one source. That focus on immediately actionable resources is what sets this site apart.   We also prioritize materials that teachers can adapt and reproduce locally—not materials that require a specific piece of software or equipment. A 3D-printable model, an SVG file, a shell script, a PDF—these can be reproduced anywhere, by anyone, without subscriptions or licenses.   Contributing Your Classroom Experience   If you use a resource here and refine it—better spacing, clearer instructions, a new variation—please share it. Even a one-paragraph note about what worked in your classroom helps other teachers make faster decisions. You can:      Comment directly on a resource page (via the form at the bottom of each post)   Open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub   Email your feedback and revised files for consideration   But I also want to emphasize: please share what didn’t work, what was confusing, or what fell short for your students or context. That kind of honest feedback is just as valuable—if not more valuable—than success stories. If you tried a resource and found it had limitations for your specific situation, didn’t address a particular accessibility need, or missed an important edge case, I genuinely want to know. Tell me what you were trying to accomplish, what got in the way, and how you solved it (if you did). This information helps me understand the blind spots in my thinking and ensures that the resources here become more robust and applicable to a wider range of real-world situations.   Contributors are welcome to publish their materials under the same open license, so that improvements circulate back to the community. Whether you’re contributing code, documentation, bug reports, or simply letting me know where the gaps are, you’re making these resources better for everyone.   Design for Sustainability   This collection is built to last. Every resource is version-controlled on GitHub and archived in plain-text, standard formats (Markdown, SVG, STL, Python). There are no dependencies on proprietary software or hosting platforms. If this site ever goes offline, anyone with access to the GitHub repository can rebuild it or fork it. That commitment to long-term availability—not just long-term accuracy—is part of the vision.

    "title": "Progressive Workout Generator",
    "excerpt":"# Progressive Workout Generator  A Python-based workout generator that creates intelligent, progressive 45-60 minute workouts with smart exercise pairing and complementary muscle group targeting.  Project site: https://mrhunsaker.github.io/Workout_Generator  Recent changes: - Generated Markdown now includes an embedded Remarkbox comment widget at the end of each rendered page (see `render_md` in `src/workout_generator.py`). - Post front-matter now enables comments by default (`comments: true`) when writing `_posts` copies.  ## Overview  This system generates 5-day workout weeks with:  - **3 sets per day** (each ~12-20 minutes) - **2-3 exercises per set** depending on day type - **5 rounds per set** before moving to the next set - **Automatic week-to-week progression** (2.5% load increase by default) - **Smart exercise pairing** - exercises complement each other - **A/B week rotation** with varied exercise selection - **Ladder days** (Day 2 & 4) with alternating ground/standing exercises - **JSON-based workflow** for clean data persistence and progression tracking  ## Key Training Principles  ### Regular Days (Days 1, 3, 5)  **3-exercise sets when possible:**  1. First exercise works specific muscle groups (ground-based) 2. Second exercise works complementary muscle groups (standing) 3. Third exercise (integration) uses muscles from exercises 1 & 2  **Example:**   - Exercise 1: Hamstring curl (ground, posterior chain) - Exercise 2: Front squat (standing, anterior chain + core) - Exercise 3: Clam walk with strap (integration using core + lower body stabilization)  **2-exercise sets when integration unavailable:**  - Just lower body + upper body pairing  ### Ladder Days (Days 2 & 4)  **Always 2 exercises alternating ground/standing:**  - One lower body exercise (ground-based) - One upper body exercise (standing) - Ladder format: 10 reps each, then 9, then 8... down to 1 - Explicitly labeled with [GROUND] and [STANDING] tags  **Example:**  ``` [GROUND] Hamstring Curl (Slider) ↔ [STANDING] Standing Row Do 10 curls, 10 rows, 9 curls, 9 rows, 8 curls, 8 rows... down to 1 each ```  ## Quick Start  ### Prerequisites  - Python 3.7 or higher - No external libraries required (uses only standard library)  ### Installation  1. Download all files to a folder:  ```bash your-workout-folder/ ├── workout_generator.py ├── exercise_library.json ├── exceptions.csv (optional) ├── add_exercise.sh (optional helper) └── README.md ```  2. Run the generator:  ```bash python3 workout_generator.py ```  3. Two files will be created:    - `generated_week.json` - Machine-readable workout data for progression tracking    - `generated_week.md` - Human-readable workout card with checkboxes  ### Week-to-Week Progression  The new JSON workflow makes progression simple and automatic:  ```bash # After completing your week, run the helper script: bash nextWeek.sh  # Or do it manually: # 1. Archive your completed week mkdir -p progress cp generated_week.json \"progress/week_$(date +%Y%m%d).json\"  # 2. Set up for progression mv generated_week.json previous_week.json  # 3. Generate next week with automatic 2.5% load increase python3 workout_generator.py ```  The system will:  - Automatically increase loads by 2.5% from your previous week - Select different exercises to avoid repetition - Switch between A/B week patterns - Track your progression history in JSON format  ### Custom Progression & Injury Exceptions  ```bash # Increase loads by 5% instead of default 2.5% python3 workout_generator.py --increase 5%  # Use injury exceptions from exceptions.csv python3 workout_generator.py --exception  # Combine both python3 workout_generator.py --increase 5% --exception ```  **Setting up exceptions.csv:**  ```csv exercise,replacement Bulgarian Split Squat,Lunge (Forward or Back) Jump Squat,Goblet Front Squat ```  ## Workout Structure  ### Weekly Pattern  ``` Monday (Day 1):    Regular - 3 sets × 3 exercises × 5 rounds Tuesday (Day 2):   LADDER - 3 sets × 2 exercises × 5 rounds Wednesday (Day 3): Regular - 3 sets × 3 exercises × 5 rounds   Thursday (Day 4):  LADDER - 3 sets × 2 exercises × 5 rounds Friday (Day 5):    Regular - 3 sets × 3 exercises × 5 rounds ```  ### Regular Day Example (Day 1, Set 1)  ``` Set 1 - 5 Rounds ├─ Exercise 1: Hamstring Curl [ground] (10-12 reps) ├─ Exercise 2: Sumo Squat [standing] (10-12 reps)   └─ Exercise 3: Front Squat - Integration (10-12 reps)  Complete all 3 exercises, rest 60-90 sec, repeat 5x total ```  ### Ladder Day Example (Day 2, Set 1)  ``` Set 1 - (Ladder Format) ├─ [GROUND] Hamstring Curl: 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 └─ [STANDING] Frontline POW Raise: 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1  Alternate: 10 curls, 10 raises, 9 curls, 9 raises... down to 1 each Complete entire ladder ```  ## Understanding the Output  ### Markdown File (`generated_week.md`)  The markdown file includes built-in progress tracking with checkboxes:  **Regular Day:**  ```markdown ## Day 1 (Regular Day) ### Set 1 #### Repeats: 5 [ ] 4 [ ] 3 [ ] 2 [ ] 1 [ ]  **1 Hamstring Curl (Yoga Ball)**  10-12 reps | Load: Bodyweight — Primer/Alt  **2 Sumo Squat**  10-12 reps | Load: 45.0 lbs — Primer/Alt  **3 Front Squat (Goblet)**  10-12 reps | Load: 45.0 lbs — Integration ```  **Ladder Day:**  ```markdown ## Day 2 (Ladder Day) ### Set 1 #### Ladder: 10 [ ] 9 [ ] 8 [ ] 7 [ ] 6 [ ] 5 [ ] 4 [ ] 3 [ ] 2 [ ] 1 [ ]  **[GROUND] Hamstring Curl (Yoga Ball)**  Ladder 10-1 reps | Load: Bodyweight — Primer/Alt  **[STANDING] Frontline POW Raise**  Ladder 10-1 reps | Load: 45.0 lbs — Primer/Alt ```  ### JSON File Structure (`generated_week.json`)  The JSON file stores complete workout data for progression tracking:  ```json [   {     \"week_type\": \"B\",     \"day\": 1,     \"set\": 1,     \"rounds\": 5,     \"is_ladder\": false,     \"set_duration\": 30.0,     \"exercise_id\": \"hamstring_yoga_ball_curl\",     \"exercise_name\": \"Hamstring Curl (Yoga Ball)\",     \"position\": \"ground\",     \"reps\": \"10-12\",     \"load\": 0.0,     \"notes\": \"Primer/Alt\",     \"total_day_duration\": 30.0   } ] ```  **Key fields:**  - `week_type`: A or B (alternates weekly) - `exercise_id`: Used for progression tracking across weeks - `load`: Current weight in lbs (automatically increased week-to-week) - `is_ladder`: Boolean indicating ladder format - `position`: Ground or standing (critical for ladder days)  ## Exercise Library Requirements  ### JSON Structure  Exercises are defined in `exercise_library.json`:  ```json {   \"id\": \"goblet_front_squat\",   \"name\": \"Front Squat (Goblet)\",   \"body_regions\": [\"lower\"],   \"movement_pattern\": \"squat\",   \"plane_of_motion\": \"sagittal\",   \"roles\": [\"primary_lower\", \"integration\"],   \"ladder_eligible\": true,   \"ground_or_standing\": \"standing\",   \"equipment\": [\"dumbbell\", \"kettlebell\"] } ```  ### Required Fields  | Field                | Type    | Description                                          | | -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | | `id`                 | string  | Unique identifier (used for progression tracking)    | | `name`               | string  | Display name                                         | | `body_regions`       | array   | [\"lower\", \"upper\", \"core\", \"arms\", \"shoulder\", etc.] | | `movement_pattern`   | string  | Type of movement (squat, hinge, push, pull, etc.)    | | `plane_of_motion`    | string  | sagittal, frontal, transverse, or multi              | | `roles`              | array   | Exercise categories (see below)                      | | `ladder_eligible`    | boolean | Can this be used in ladder format?                   | | `ground_or_standing` | string  | \"ground\" or \"standing\"                               | | `equipment`          | array   | Required equipment (or empty for bodyweight)         |  ### Exercise Roles Explained  - **primary_lower**: Main lower body movements (squats, lunges, step-ups) - **primary_upper**: Main upper body (rows, presses, pull-ups) - **posterior_chain**: Hamstrings/glutes focused (curls, hip thrusts, bridges) - **integration**: Complex movements using multiple muscle groups (Copenhagen plank, loaded carries, complex stabilization) - **accessory**: Isolation or supplementary work (curls, raises, rotator cuff work)  ### Ground vs Standing  Critical for ladder days and exercise pairing:  - **ground**: Floor-based exercises (push-ups, planks, slider curls, bridges) - **standing**: Upright exercises (squats, rows, overhead press, lunges)  Ladder days alternate these positions to manage fatigue and allow continuous work.  ## Adding New Exercises  ### Method 1: Manual JSON Editing  Add directly to `exercise_library.json`:  ```json {   \"id\": \"deficit_push_up\",   \"name\": \"Deficit Push Up\",   \"body_regions\": [\"upper\", \"core\"],   \"movement_pattern\": \"horizontal_push\",   \"plane_of_motion\": \"sagittal\",   \"roles\": [\"primary_upper\"],   \"ladder_eligible\": true,   \"ground_or_standing\": \"ground\",   \"equipment\": [\"yoga_block\"] } ```  ### Method 2: Using the Helper Script  The included `add_exercise.sh` script provides an interactive way to add exercises:  ```bash bash add_exercise.sh ```  You'll be prompted for:  - Exercise name - Exercise ID (lowercase, underscores) - Body regions (comma-separated) - Roles (comma-separated) - Equipment (comma-separated) - Ladder eligible (true/false) - Position (ground/standing)  **Requirements:** The script uses `jq` for JSON manipulation. Install with:  ```bash # macOS brew install jq  # Ubuntu/Debian sudo apt-get install jq ```  ## Customization  ### Adjusting Workout Parameters  Edit these constants in `workout_generator.py`:  ```python WORKOUT_DAYS = 5          # Days per week SETS_PER_DAY = 3          # Sets per workout day ROUNDS_PER_SET = 5        # Times through each set ```  **Example customization:**  - For shorter workouts: `ROUNDS_PER_SET = 3` - For more variety: `SETS_PER_DAY = 4` - For 6-day program: `WORKOUT_DAYS = 6`  ### Default Load Assignment  The system assigns starting loads based on equipment:  ```python def get_base_load(exercise):     eq = exercise.get(\"equipment\", [])     if \"dumbbell\" in eq: return 10.0     if \"kettlebell\" in eq: return 10.0     return 0.0  # Bodyweight ```  Modify these values to match your starting strength level.  ## Integration Exercise Design  For 3-exercise sets to work optimally, integration exercises should:  1. **Use multiple muscle groups** from the first two exercises 2. **Challenge stability and coordination**  3. **Be appropriate as a \"finisher\"** for the set  **Good integration examples:**  - Copenhagen Plank (adductors + obliques + core stability) - Clam Walk with Strap (glutes + hip stabilizers + core) - March in Place with Strap (core anti-rotation + hip flexors) - Front Squat (legs + core + upper back stabilization)  **What makes integration work:** The first two exercises prepare/fatigue specific muscle groups, then the integration exercise requires those same muscles to work together in a complex pattern.  ## Week Type (A/B Rotation)  Automatically alternates based on calendar week number:  - **Odd weeks** (1, 3, 5, etc.) = **Week A** - **Even weeks** (2, 4, 6, etc.) = **Week B**  This creates natural exercise variety without manual tracking. The week type is stored in the JSON output for reference.  ## Understanding Progression  ### How It Works  1. **First week**: Uses default loads (10 lbs for weighted, bodyweight for others) 2. **Subsequent weeks**: Reads `previous_week.json` and increases loads  ```python def calculate_progression(exercise_id, previous_data, increase_str):     \"\"\"Calculate load progression using the provided increase percentage.\"\"\"     if exercise_id not in previous_data:         return None     multiplier = 1 + (float(increase_str.replace(\"%\", \"\")) / 100)     # Average all instances of this exercise from previous week     loads = [float(r[\"load\"]) for r in previous_data[exercise_id]]     return round((sum(loads) / len(loads)) * multiplier, 1) ```  ### Example Progression  Week 1: Goblet Squat @ 10.0 lbs Week 2: Goblet Squat @ 10.3 lbs (10.0 × 1.025) Week 3: Goblet Squat @ 10.5 lbs (10.3 × 1.025) Week 4: Goblet Squat @ 10.8 lbs (10.5 × 1.025)  ### Why JSON vs CSV?  The previous CSV format had limitations:  - Hard to parse complex nested data - No support for metadata - Difficult to track exercise relationships - Manual string parsing required  **JSON advantages:**  - Native Python support (no external libraries) - Preserves data types (numbers, booleans, arrays) - Easy to query by `exercise_id` for progression - Clean integration with modern tools - Human-readable when formatted  ## Tips for Best Results  ### Execution  1. **Warm-up**: 5-10 minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching 2. **Rest between rounds**: 60-90 seconds for regular sets, 90-120 seconds for ladders 3. **Form over speed**: Perfect technique on every rep 4. **Breathing**: Exhale on exertion, inhale on return 5. **Check boxes**: Mark off completed rounds in the markdown file  ### Programming  1. **Consistency**: Train 5 days/week 2. **Rest days**: Full rest or light activity on weekends 3. **Sleep**: 7-9 hours for recovery 4. **Nutrition**: Align calories with your goals (surplus for building, maintenance for recomp) 5. **Deload**: Every 4-6 weeks, reduce loads by 30-40% or take a full rest week  ### Progress Tracking  The `nextWeek.sh` script automatically archives your progress:  ```bash bash nextWeek.sh ```  This creates:  ``` progress/ ├── week_20241224.json ├── week_20241231.json └── week_20250107.json ```  You can analyze progression over time by comparing these JSON files.  ## Troubleshooting  ### \"Not enough exercises selected\"  **Cause:** Insufficient exercises in library for the selection criteria  **Solution:** Add more exercises to `exercise_library.json`, especially:  - Lower body movements (primary_lower role) - Upper body movements (primary_upper role) - Integration exercises - Mix of ground and standing positions  ### \"No complementary exercises found\"  **Cause:** Limited integration exercises available  **Solution:** This is normal behavior. The system will create 2-exercise sets instead. To enable more 3-exercise sets, add exercises with the \"integration\" role that use multiple body regions.  ### Workouts feel too short/long  **Solution:** Adjust `ROUNDS_PER_SET`:  - Too short? Increase to 6-7 rounds - Too long? Decrease to 3-4 rounds  ### Same exercises every week  **Solution:** The A/B week rotation provides some variety, but for more diversity:  1. Expand your exercise library with more options per category 2. Add exercises with similar roles but different movement patterns 3. Consider manually curating a larger pool  ### Load not increasing  **Check:**  1. Does `previous_week.json` exist? 2. Are `exercise_id` values consistent in your library? 3. Run with verbose output: `python3 workout_generator.py --increase 2.5%`  ### Helper script not working  **Cause:** Missing `jq` dependency  **Fix:**  ```bash # macOS brew install jq  # Ubuntu/Debian   sudo apt-get install jq  # Or manually add to JSON without the script ```  ## File Structure  ``` . ├── workout_generator.py       # Main generator script ├── exercise_library.json      # Exercise database   ├── exceptions.csv             # Optional injury replacements ├── add_exercise.sh            # Optional helper script ├── nextWeek.sh                # Progression automation script ├── generated_week.json        # Output: machine-readable, used for progression ├── generated_week.md          # Output: human-readable with checkboxes ├── previous_week.json         # Auto-created: last week's data for progression ├── progress/                  # Auto-created: archived weeks │   ├── week_20241224.json │   └── week_20241231.json └── README.md                  # This file ```  ## Sample Weekly Schedule  ``` Monday:    Day 1 (Regular) - ~45-60 minutes Tuesday:   Day 2 (Ladder) - ~40-50 minutes Wednesday: Day 3 (Regular) - ~45-60 minutes Thursday:  Day 4 (Ladder) - ~40-50 minutes Friday:    Day 5 (Regular) - ~45-60 minutes Saturday:  Active recovery (walk, yoga, light cardio) Sunday:    Full rest ```  ## Advanced: Understanding the Selection Algorithm  ### Regular Day Set Building  1. **Select integration target**: Choose randomly from exercises with \"integration\" role 2. **Find complementary exercises**:     - Filter for ground-based exercises sharing body regions with target    - Filter for standing exercises sharing body regions with target 3. **Assign positions**:    - Exercise 1: Ground exercise (prepares specific muscles)    - Exercise 2: Standing exercise (prepares complementary muscles)    - Exercise 3: Integration exercise (uses both sets of muscles)  ### Ladder Day Set Building  1. **Select lower body**: Choose from ground-based, ladder-eligible, lower body movements 2. **Select upper body**: Choose from standing, ladder-eligible, upper body movements 3. **Label clearly**: [GROUND] and [STANDING] tags for easy execution  ### Avoiding Repetition  - `used_today` set tracks exercises already selected for current day - Different exercises are chosen for each set - A/B week rotation provides variety across weeks - Progression tracking via `exercise_id` ensures consistent development  ## Sharing & Customization  This system is designed to be easily shared and modified:  ### Sharing with Training Partners  1. **Share the basics:**     ```bash    # Core files only    workout_generator.py    exercise_library.json    README.md    ```  2. **Share with your customizations:**     ```bash    # Include your exercise library    workout_generator.py    exercise_library.json (your expanded version)    exceptions.csv (if using)    README.md    ```  3. **Share with progression history:**     ```bash    # Everything including your progress    workout_generator.py    exercise_library.json    generated_week.json    generated_week.md    progress/    README.md    ```  ### Creating Exercise Library Variants  Consider creating specialized versions:  - `exercise_library_home.json` - Minimal equipment - `exercise_library_gym.json` - Full gym access - `exercise_library_rehab.json` - Modified for injury recovery  Switch between them by editing `LIBRARY_JSON` constant in the script.  ## Contributing  If you create useful exercises or improvements:  1. Document your additions in JSON format 2. Include notes on equipment requirements 3. Specify appropriate roles and positions 4.

    "title": "Progressive Workout Generator",
    "excerpt":"# Progressive Workout Generator  A Python-based workout generator that creates intelligent, progressive 45-60 minute workouts with smart exercise pairing and complementary muscle group targeting.  ## Overview  This system generates 5-day workout weeks with:  - **3 sets per day** (each ~12-20 minutes) - **2-3 exercises per set** depending on day type - **5 rounds per set** before moving to the next set - **Automatic week-to-week progression** (2.5% load increase by default) - **Smart exercise pairing** - exercises complement each other - **A/B week rotation** with varied exercise selection - **Ladder days** (Day 2 & 4) with alternating ground/standing exercises - **JSON-based workflow** for clean data persistence and progression tracking  ## Key Training Principles  ### Regular Days (Days 1, 3, 5)  **3-exercise sets when possible:**  1. First exercise works specific muscle groups (ground-based) 2. Second exercise works complementary muscle groups (standing) 3. Third exercise (integration) uses muscles from exercises 1 & 2  **Example:**   - Exercise 1: Hamstring curl (ground, posterior chain) - Exercise 2: Front squat (standing, anterior chain + core) - Exercise 3: Clam walk with strap (integration using core + lower body stabilization)  **2-exercise sets when integration unavailable:**  - Just lower body + upper body pairing  ### Ladder Days (Days 2 & 4)  **Always 2 exercises alternating ground/standing:**  - One lower body exercise (ground-based) - One upper body exercise (standing) - Ladder format: 10 reps each, then 9, then 8... down to 1 - Explicitly labeled with [GROUND] and [STANDING] tags  **Example:**  ``` [GROUND] Hamstring Curl (Slider) ↔ [STANDING] Standing Row Do 10 curls, 10 rows, 9 curls, 9 rows, 8 curls, 8 rows... down to 1 each ```  ## Quick Start  ### Prerequisites  - Python 3.7 or higher - No external libraries required (uses only standard library)  ### Installation  1. Download all files to a folder:  ```bash your-workout-folder/ ├── workout_generator.py ├── exercise_library.json ├── exceptions.csv (optional) ├── add_exercise.sh (optional helper) └── README.md ```  2. Run the generator:  ```bash python3 workout_generator.py ```  3. Two files will be created:    - `generated_week.json` - Machine-readable workout data for progression tracking    - `generated_week.md` - Human-readable workout card with checkboxes  ### Week-to-Week Progression  The new JSON workflow makes progression simple and automatic:  ```bash # After completing your week, run the helper script: bash nextWeek.sh  # Or do it manually: # 1. Archive your completed week mkdir -p progress cp generated_week.json \"progress/week_$(date +%Y%m%d).json\"  # 2. Set up for progression mv generated_week.json previous_week.json  # 3. Generate next week with automatic 2.5% load increase python3 workout_generator.py ```  The system will:  - Automatically increase loads by 2.5% from your previous week - Select different exercises to avoid repetition - Switch between A/B week patterns - Track your progression history in JSON format  ### Custom Progression & Injury Exceptions  ```bash # Increase loads by 5% instead of default 2.5% python3 workout_generator.py --increase 5%  # Use injury exceptions from exceptions.csv python3 workout_generator.py --exception  # Combine both python3 workout_generator.py --increase 5% --exception ```  **Setting up exceptions.csv:**  ```csv exercise,replacement Bulgarian Split Squat,Lunge (Forward or Back) Jump Squat,Goblet Front Squat ```  ## Workout Structure  ### Weekly Pattern  ``` Monday (Day 1):    Regular - 3 sets × 3 exercises × 5 rounds Tuesday (Day 2):   LADDER - 3 sets × 2 exercises × 5 rounds Wednesday (Day 3): Regular - 3 sets × 3 exercises × 5 rounds   Thursday (Day 4):  LADDER - 3 sets × 2 exercises × 5 rounds Friday (Day 5):    Regular - 3 sets × 3 exercises × 5 rounds ```  ### Regular Day Example (Day 1, Set 1)  ``` Set 1 - 5 Rounds ├─ Exercise 1: Hamstring Curl [ground] (10-12 reps) ├─ Exercise 2: Sumo Squat [standing] (10-12 reps)   └─ Exercise 3: Front Squat - Integration (10-12 reps)  Complete all 3 exercises, rest 60-90 sec, repeat 5x total ```  ### Ladder Day Example (Day 2, Set 1)  ``` Set 1 - (Ladder Format) ├─ [GROUND] Hamstring Curl: 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 └─ [STANDING] Frontline POW Raise: 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1  Alternate: 10 curls, 10 raises, 9 curls, 9 raises... down to 1 each Complete entire ladder ```  ## Understanding the Output  ### Markdown File (`generated_week.md`)  The markdown file includes built-in progress tracking with checkboxes:  **Regular Day:**  ```markdown ## Day 1 (Regular Day) ### Set 1 #### Repeats: 5 [ ] 4 [ ] 3 [ ] 2 [ ] 1 [ ]  **1 Hamstring Curl (Yoga Ball)**  10-12 reps | Load: Bodyweight — Primer/Alt  **2 Sumo Squat**  10-12 reps | Load: 45.0 lbs — Primer/Alt  **3 Front Squat (Goblet)**  10-12 reps | Load: 45.0 lbs — Integration ```  **Ladder Day:**  ```markdown ## Day 2 (Ladder Day) ### Set 1 #### Ladder: 10 [ ] 9 [ ] 8 [ ] 7 [ ] 6 [ ] 5 [ ] 4 [ ] 3 [ ] 2 [ ] 1 [ ]  **[GROUND] Hamstring Curl (Yoga Ball)**  Ladder 10-1 reps | Load: Bodyweight — Primer/Alt  **[STANDING] Frontline POW Raise**  Ladder 10-1 reps | Load: 45.0 lbs — Primer/Alt ```  ### JSON File Structure (`generated_week.json`)  The JSON file stores complete workout data for progression tracking:  ```json [   {     \"week_type\": \"B\",     \"day\": 1,     \"set\": 1,     \"rounds\": 5,     \"is_ladder\": false,     \"set_duration\": 30.0,     \"exercise_id\": \"hamstring_yoga_ball_curl\",     \"exercise_name\": \"Hamstring Curl (Yoga Ball)\",     \"position\": \"ground\",     \"reps\": \"10-12\",     \"load\": 0.0,     \"notes\": \"Primer/Alt\",     \"total_day_duration\": 30.0   } ] ```  **Key fields:**  - `week_type`: A or B (alternates weekly) - `exercise_id`: Used for progression tracking across weeks - `load`: Current weight in lbs (automatically increased week-to-week) - `is_ladder`: Boolean indicating ladder format - `position`: Ground or standing (critical for ladder days)  ## Exercise Library Requirements  ### JSON Structure  Exercises are defined in `exercise_library.json`:  ```json {   \"id\": \"goblet_front_squat\",   \"name\": \"Front Squat (Goblet)\",   \"body_regions\": [\"lower\"],   \"movement_pattern\": \"squat\",   \"plane_of_motion\": \"sagittal\",   \"roles\": [\"primary_lower\", \"integration\"],   \"ladder_eligible\": true,   \"ground_or_standing\": \"standing\",   \"equipment\": [\"dumbbell\", \"kettlebell\"] } ```  ### Required Fields  | Field                | Type    | Description                                          | | -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | | `id`                 | string  | Unique identifier (used for progression tracking)    | | `name`               | string  | Display name                                         | | `body_regions`       | array   | [\"lower\", \"upper\", \"core\", \"arms\", \"shoulder\", etc.] | | `movement_pattern`   | string  | Type of movement (squat, hinge, push, pull, etc.)    | | `plane_of_motion`    | string  | sagittal, frontal, transverse, or multi              | | `roles`              | array   | Exercise categories (see below)                      | | `ladder_eligible`    | boolean | Can this be used in ladder format?                   | | `ground_or_standing` | string  | \"ground\" or \"standing\"                               | | `equipment`          | array   | Required equipment (or empty for bodyweight)         |  ### Exercise Roles Explained  - **primary_lower**: Main lower body movements (squats, lunges, step-ups) - **primary_upper**: Main upper body (rows, presses, pull-ups) - **posterior_chain**: Hamstrings/glutes focused (curls, hip thrusts, bridges) - **integration**: Complex movements using multiple muscle groups (Copenhagen plank, loaded carries, complex stabilization) - **accessory**: Isolation or supplementary work (curls, raises, rotator cuff work)  ### Ground vs Standing  Critical for ladder days and exercise pairing:  - **ground**: Floor-based exercises (push-ups, planks, slider curls, bridges) - **standing**: Upright exercises (squats, rows, overhead press, lunges)  Ladder days alternate these positions to manage fatigue and allow continuous work.  ## Adding New Exercises  ### Method 1: Manual JSON Editing  Add directly to `exercise_library.json`:  ```json {   \"id\": \"deficit_push_up\",   \"name\": \"Deficit Push Up\",   \"body_regions\": [\"upper\", \"core\"],   \"movement_pattern\": \"horizontal_push\",   \"plane_of_motion\": \"sagittal\",   \"roles\": [\"primary_upper\"],   \"ladder_eligible\": true,   \"ground_or_standing\": \"ground\",   \"equipment\": [\"yoga_block\"] } ```  ### Method 2: Using the Helper Script  The included `add_exercise.sh` script provides an interactive way to add exercises:  ```bash bash add_exercise.sh ```  You'll be prompted for:  - Exercise name - Exercise ID (lowercase, underscores) - Body regions (comma-separated) - Roles (comma-separated) - Equipment (comma-separated) - Ladder eligible (true/false) - Position (ground/standing)  **Requirements:** The script uses `jq` for JSON manipulation. Install with:  ```bash # macOS brew install jq  # Ubuntu/Debian sudo apt-get install jq ```  ## Customization  ### Adjusting Workout Parameters  Edit these constants in `workout_generator.py`:  ```python WORKOUT_DAYS = 5          # Days per week SETS_PER_DAY = 3          # Sets per workout day ROUNDS_PER_SET = 5        # Times through each set ```  **Example customization:**  - For shorter workouts: `ROUNDS_PER_SET = 3` - For more variety: `SETS_PER_DAY = 4` - For 6-day program: `WORKOUT_DAYS = 6`  ### Default Load Assignment  The system assigns starting loads based on equipment:  ```python def get_base_load(exercise):     eq = exercise.get(\"equipment\", [])     if \"dumbbell\" in eq: return 10.0     if \"kettlebell\" in eq: return 10.0     return 0.0  # Bodyweight ```  Modify these values to match your starting strength level.  ## Integration Exercise Design  For 3-exercise sets to work optimally, integration exercises should:  1. **Use multiple muscle groups** from the first two exercises 2. **Challenge stability and coordination**  3. **Be appropriate as a \"finisher\"** for the set  **Good integration examples:**  - Copenhagen Plank (adductors + obliques + core stability) - Clam Walk with Strap (glutes + hip stabilizers + core) - March in Place with Strap (core anti-rotation + hip flexors) - Front Squat (legs + core + upper back stabilization)  **What makes integration work:** The first two exercises prepare/fatigue specific muscle groups, then the integration exercise requires those same muscles to work together in a complex pattern.  ## Week Type (A/B Rotation)  Automatically alternates based on calendar week number:  - **Odd weeks** (1, 3, 5, etc.) = **Week A** - **Even weeks** (2, 4, 6, etc.) = **Week B**  This creates natural exercise variety without manual tracking. The week type is stored in the JSON output for reference.  ## Understanding Progression  ### How It Works  1. **First week**: Uses default loads (10 lbs for weighted, bodyweight for others) 2. **Subsequent weeks**: Reads `previous_week.json` and increases loads  ```python def calculate_progression(exercise_id, previous_data, increase_str):     \"\"\"Calculate load progression using the provided increase percentage.\"\"\"     if exercise_id not in previous_data:         return None     multiplier = 1 + (float(increase_str.replace(\"%\", \"\")) / 100)     # Average all instances of this exercise from previous week     loads = [float(r[\"load\"]) for r in previous_data[exercise_id]]     return round((sum(loads) / len(loads)) * multiplier, 1) ```  ### Example Progression  Week 1: Goblet Squat @ 10.0 lbs Week 2: Goblet Squat @ 10.3 lbs (10.0 × 1.025) Week 3: Goblet Squat @ 10.5 lbs (10.3 × 1.025) Week 4: Goblet Squat @ 10.8 lbs (10.5 × 1.025)  ### Why JSON vs CSV?  The previous CSV format had limitations:  - Hard to parse complex nested data - No support for metadata - Difficult to track exercise relationships - Manual string parsing required  **JSON advantages:**  - Native Python support (no external libraries) - Preserves data types (numbers, booleans, arrays) - Easy to query by `exercise_id` for progression - Clean integration with modern tools - Human-readable when formatted  ## Tips for Best Results  ### Execution  1. **Warm-up**: 5-10 minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching 2. **Rest between rounds**: 60-90 seconds for regular sets, 90-120 seconds for ladders 3. **Form over speed**: Perfect technique on every rep 4. **Breathing**: Exhale on exertion, inhale on return 5. **Check boxes**: Mark off completed rounds in the markdown file  ### Programming  1. **Consistency**: Train 5 days/week 2. **Rest days**: Full rest or light activity on weekends 3. **Sleep**: 7-9 hours for recovery 4. **Nutrition**: Align calories with your goals (surplus for building, maintenance for recomp) 5. **Deload**: Every 4-6 weeks, reduce loads by 30-40% or take a full rest week  ### Progress Tracking  The `nextWeek.sh` script automatically archives your progress:  ```bash bash nextWeek.sh ```  This creates:  ``` progress/ ├── week_20241224.json ├── week_20241231.json └── week_20250107.json ```  You can analyze progression over time by comparing these JSON files.  ## Troubleshooting  ### \"Not enough exercises selected\"  **Cause:** Insufficient exercises in library for the selection criteria  **Solution:** Add more exercises to `exercise_library.json`, especially:  - Lower body movements (primary_lower role) - Upper body movements (primary_upper role) - Integration exercises - Mix of ground and standing positions  ### \"No complementary exercises found\"  **Cause:** Limited integration exercises available  **Solution:** This is normal behavior. The system will create 2-exercise sets instead. To enable more 3-exercise sets, add exercises with the \"integration\" role that use multiple body regions.  ### Workouts feel too short/long  **Solution:** Adjust `ROUNDS_PER_SET`:  - Too short? Increase to 6-7 rounds - Too long? Decrease to 3-4 rounds  ### Same exercises every week  **Solution:** The A/B week rotation provides some variety, but for more diversity:  1. Expand your exercise library with more options per category 2. Add exercises with similar roles but different movement patterns 3. Consider manually curating a larger pool  ### Load not increasing  **Check:**  1. Does `previous_week.json` exist? 2. Are `exercise_id` values consistent in your library? 3. Run with verbose output: `python3 workout_generator.py --increase 2.5%`  ### Helper script not working  **Cause:** Missing `jq` dependency  **Fix:**  ```bash # macOS brew install jq  # Ubuntu/Debian   sudo apt-get install jq  # Or manually add to JSON without the script ```  ## File Structure  ``` . ├── workout_generator.py       # Main generator script ├── exercise_library.json      # Exercise database   ├── exceptions.csv             # Optional injury replacements ├── add_exercise.sh            # Optional helper script ├── nextWeek.sh                # Progression automation script ├── generated_week.json        # Output: machine-readable, used for progression ├── generated_week.md          # Output: human-readable with checkboxes ├── previous_week.json         # Auto-created: last week's data for progression ├── progress/                  # Auto-created: archived weeks │   ├── week_20241224.json │   └── week_20241231.json └── README.md                  # This file ```  ## Sample Weekly Schedule  ``` Monday:    Day 1 (Regular) - ~45-60 minutes Tuesday:   Day 2 (Ladder) - ~40-50 minutes Wednesday: Day 3 (Regular) - ~45-60 minutes Thursday:  Day 4 (Ladder) - ~40-50 minutes Friday:    Day 5 (Regular) - ~45-60 minutes Saturday:  Active recovery (walk, yoga, light cardio) Sunday:    Full rest ```  ## Advanced: Understanding the Selection Algorithm  ### Regular Day Set Building  1. **Select integration target**: Choose randomly from exercises with \"integration\" role 2. **Find complementary exercises**:     - Filter for ground-based exercises sharing body regions with target    - Filter for standing exercises sharing body regions with target 3. **Assign positions**:    - Exercise 1: Ground exercise (prepares specific muscles)    - Exercise 2: Standing exercise (prepares complementary muscles)    - Exercise 3: Integration exercise (uses both sets of muscles)  ### Ladder Day Set Building  1. **Select lower body**: Choose from ground-based, ladder-eligible, lower body movements 2. **Select upper body**: Choose from standing, ladder-eligible, upper body movements 3. **Label clearly**: [GROUND] and [STANDING] tags for easy execution  ### Avoiding Repetition  - `used_today` set tracks exercises already selected for current day - Different exercises are chosen for each set - A/B week rotation provides variety across weeks - Progression tracking via `exercise_id` ensures consistent development  ## Sharing & Customization  This system is designed to be easily shared and modified:  ### Sharing with Training Partners  1. **Share the basics:**     ```bash    # Core files only    workout_generator.py    exercise_library.json    README.md    ```  2. **Share with your customizations:**     ```bash    # Include your exercise library    workout_generator.py    exercise_library.json (your expanded version)    exceptions.csv (if using)    README.md    ```  3. **Share with progression history:**     ```bash    # Everything including your progress    workout_generator.py    exercise_library.json    generated_week.json    generated_week.md    progress/    README.md    ```  ### Creating Exercise Library Variants  Consider creating specialized versions:  - `exercise_library_home.json` - Minimal equipment - `exercise_library_gym.json` - Full gym access - `exercise_library_rehab.json` - Modified for injury recovery  Switch between them by editing `LIBRARY_JSON` constant in the script.  ## Contributing  If you create useful exercises or improvements:  1.
